# shampoo-sales
I did the EDA (python) and build ARIMA model (SQL) to forecast shampoo sales (Sales_of_shampoo) for the next 6 months. Forecasted results will be visualized using Python.
## dataset
Dataset sales_of_shampoo_over_a_three_year.csv with 2 columns:
- Month column, containing the date of each data sample (one month at a time)
- Sales_of_shampoo column: shampoo sales over of each month.
